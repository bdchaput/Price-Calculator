# Actual Price Calculator
The Actual Price Calculator is a simple python app made using tkinter and customtkinter which calculates the price of an item or service with tax and tip included. The user is given the option of how much they want to tip (if they want to tip at all) and which province they are shopping in. The program then calculates and displays the final price.
